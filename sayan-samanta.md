## Overview of Project
FunwithScience is the project to make your life easy by providing come physics, mathematics complex calculators which takes few milliseconds to calculate certain complex values.
Also it provides the questions section to assess your learning. Hhere the user just needs to enter the values and the project calculates the result using the formula within milliseconds.
This is faster because it needs no server side interaction while calculating and all. It is built using react.js for calculators, pages and php for backend.

    <h4>Fixed the responsiveness of calculators</h4>
    Previously the calculator page was like this:

    <h4>Added image blurred fast load</h4>
    (BEFORE) Previously the image was taking much time to load in login and signup page:

    <br>
    (AFTER) I have optimised the image loading to load blurred version first to give better user experience
